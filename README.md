This file assigns 4 columns of information from an Excel sheet, and checks to see if column c contains columns a and b, if it does it will copy the cell in the matching row of column d and paste it into a list, which will eventually paste its results into column E and then will save that file. 

The column names of A, B, C, D, and E, are not representative of where in the Excel sheet it's copying information from, those names were only used for the sake of explaining the function. 

The use case for the development of this script was a project at my job, which required this function but is confidential on what the use case was.
